Image classification model

The purpose of this project is to train an image classification model for human, object, face, and gesture detection and recognition. We used different data sets for multiple use cases.
Training an image classification model for face recognition, and object detection using libraries:
-  [OpenCV](https://opencv.org), 
- [Scikit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org), 
- [Pillow](https://pypi.org),
- [Python](https://www.python.org),
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org), and [ PyTorch](https://pytorch.org)
