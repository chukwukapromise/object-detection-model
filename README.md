Object detection model

The purpose of this project is to train an image classification model for object detection. We used large data sets for model training.
Training an image classification model for object detection using libraries:
-  [OpenCV](https://opencv.org), 
- [Scikit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org), 
- [Pillow](https://pypi.org),
- [Python](https://www.python.org),
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org), and [ PyTorch](https://pytorch.org)
